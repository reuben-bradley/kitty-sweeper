# KittySweeper

A Minesweeper clone, but *cute*!

## Instructions

Works in Chrome, untested in other browsers at this time.

Select a game difficulty, or set a custom grid, and press "New Game".  Click to reveal the tile, right-click (or long-press on mobile) to flag or question the tile instead.  Try not to "step" on any of the cats on the grid, using the numbers revealed!
